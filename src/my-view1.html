      <h1>Our Story</h1>
	  <p>
	  Zach and Nora met while interning at Google the summer of 2012. They became fast friends,
	  but it wasn’t until the next summer after a fateful viewing of Terminator and Terminator 2
	  that they first started dating. Long-distance couldn’t keep the two apart, though it did provide
	  many frequent flyer miles. After graduating in 2015, they drove across the country to California
	  where they could begin their careers and their life living together.
	  </p>
      <p>
	  In November 2017, Zach and Nora took a much needed vacation to Maui, which Zach suspiciously 
	  did much of the planning for. On their second day, Nora was surprised at the beach by a sailboat 
	  crew. As the sun was setting, Zach carefully balanced on one knee (trickier than it sounds on a 
	  moving sailboat) and popped the question. Despite minor seasickness, Nora still managed to say yes.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Zach and Nora couldn’t be happier to start this next chapter in their lives, and can’t wait to celebrate 
	  surrounded by friends and family. Hopefully the years ahead feature many more elaborate Halloween costumes, 
	  good bourbon, and 80s sci-fi classics.
